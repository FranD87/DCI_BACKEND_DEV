Scenario: You are building an application that can perform different operations on different types of shapes. You want to create an abstract class to define common attributes and methods that all shape classes should have.

Task 1: Create an abstract class named "Shape" that has two abstract methods: "area" and "perimeter". Then, create 3 child classes named "Rectangle", "Triangle" and "Circle" that inherit from the Shape class and implement their own versions of the "area" and "perimeter" methods.

Task 2: Create Mixin class "Angle" what will return string 'This Shape has angles'. This method should be implemented only for "Rectangle" and "Triangle"
