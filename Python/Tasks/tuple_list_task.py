# Exercise 1: Reverse the tuple
tuple1 = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)
# Expected output:
# (50, 40, 30, 20, 10)

# Exercise 2: Access value 20 from the tuple
tuple2 = ("Orange", [10, 20, 30], (5, 15, 25))

# Exercise 3: Create a tuple with single item 50

# Exercise 4: Unpack the tuple into 4 variables
tuple3 = (10, 20, 30, 40)
# Your code
# print(a) # should print 10
# print(b) # should print 20
# print(c) # should print 30
# print(d) # should print 40

# Exercise 5: Swap two tuples in Python
tuple_1 = (11, 22)
tuple_2 = (99, 88)
# Expected output:
# tuple1: (99, 88)
# tuple2: (11, 22)

# Exercise 6: Modify the tuple
# Given is a nested tuple. Write a program to modify the first item (22) of a list inside a following tuple to 222
tuple6 = (11, [22, 33], 44, 55)
# Expected output:
# tuple1: (11, [222, 33], 44, 55)


# Exercise 7:
# Write a Python function that takes two lists and returns True if they have at least one common item.
def check_lists(list1: list, list2: list) -> bool:
    # Write your code here
    pass


# Exercise 8:
# Write a Python function to insert a given string at the beginning of all items in a list.
# Sample list : [1,2,3,4], string : emp
# Expected output : ['emp1', 'emp2', 'emp3', 'emp4']
# NOTE: Items in given string can be str, int, float NOT list, tuple, set or dictionary
def insert_to_list(my_list: list, my_string: str) -> list:
    # Write your code here
    pass
