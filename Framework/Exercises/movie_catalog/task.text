Project Title: Movie Catalog with Django

Project Description:
In this beginner-friendly project, you will build a movie catalog web application using Django, a powerful Python web framework. The application will allow users to browse and search for movies based on various parameters passed through GET requests in the URL. The movie information will be stored in a database without any relations, keeping the project simple and focused on the core concepts.

Project Steps:

Step 1: Setup Django Project
Step 2: Create Movie App
Step 3: Define Movie Model
    In the models.py file of the movie_app, define a Movie model with the following fields:
    title (CharField)
    genre (CharField)
    year (IntegerField)
    director (CharField)
    description (TextField)
Step 4: Set Up Database
    Apply the initial database migrations: python manage.py migrate
Step 5: Create Views
    In the views.py file of the movie_app, define view functions to handle different requests, such as:
    movie_list(request): Renders a list of movies.
    movie_details(request, movie_id): Renders the details of a specific movie.
    search_movies(request): Handles the movie search functionality.
Step 6: Define URL Patterns
Step 7: Test the Application
    Example Usage:
        Display Movie List:

        URL: http://localhost:8000/movies/
        Description: This URL will display a list of all movies in the catalog.
        View Movie Details:

        URL: http://localhost:8000/movie/<movie_id>/
        Description: Replace <movie_id> with the ID of the movie you want to view. This URL will display the details of the specified movie.
        Search for Movies:

        URL: http://localhost:8000/search/?title=<search_query>
        Description: Replace <search_query> with the title or genre of the movie you want to search for. This URL will display a list of movies matching the search criteria.
        Note: You can add additional parameters to the search URL based on the fields you defined in the Movie model.
